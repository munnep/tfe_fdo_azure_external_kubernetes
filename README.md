# Creating a TFE external installation on Kubernetes - Azure  

With this repository you will install a Terraform Enterprise environment on a Azure Kubernetes cluster (AKS) using Terraform. Kubernetes only supports an active-active configuration with an external Redis database. 

The manual steps for creating a TFE external installation on Kubernetes can be found [here](manual_steps/README.md)

# Creating the infrastructure

We create the infrastructure according to the following diagram for the kubernetes environment
![](diagram/diagram_tfe_fdo_azure_external_kubernetes.png)  

# Prerequisites
## AWS
We will be using AWS for creating the DNS records. 

## Azure
Make sure you have an Azure account. Please make sure the az cli tool is installed and confired to get the AKS configuration downloaded

## Install terraform  
See the following documentation [How to install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

## kubectl
Make sure kubectl is available on your system. Please see the documentation [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

## helm
Make sure helm is available on your system. Please see the documentation [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

# How to

- Clone this repository
```
https://github.com/munnep/tfe_fdo_azure_external_kubernetes
```
- Set your AWS credentials
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=
```

## Now you will need to create the infrastructure for AKS
- Go into the directory `tfe_fdo_azure_external_kubernetes/infra`
```
cd tfe_fdo_aws_external_kubernetes/infra
```
- Create a file called `variables.auto.tfvars` with the following contents
```
# General
tag_prefix        = "tfe11"                      # General prefix used in the code and naming
# Azure    
vnet_cidr         = "10.211.0.0/16"              # Network for the VPC to be created
postgres_user     = "tfe"                        # Postgres user to be used 
postgres_password = "Password#1"                 # Password for the postgres user
storage_account   = "tfe11patrick"               # Name of the storage account to be created which should be unique
``````
- Initialize terraform
```
terraform init
```
- Create the AWS resources
```
terraform apply
```
- The output should be the following
```
Apply complete! Resources: 24 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

cluster_name = "tfe11"
container_name = "tfe11-container"
kubernetes_configuration = "az aks get-credentials --resource-group tfe11 --name tfe11"
pg_address = "tfe11-psqlflexibleserver.postgres.database.azure.com"
pg_dbname = "tfe"
pg_password = <sensitive>
pg_user = "tfe"
prefix = "tfe11"
redis_host = "tfe11-redis.redis.cache.windows.net"
redis_port = 6379
redis_primary_access_key = <sensitive>
storage_account = "tfe11patrick"
storage_account_key = <sensitive>
```
- The kubernetes environment is created from an infrastructure standpoint.   

## Now you will need to deploy Terraform Enterprise on to this cluster

- Go to the directory `../tfe`
```
cd ../tfe
```
- Create a file called `variables.auto.tfvars` with the following contents
```
dns_hostname               = "tfe11"                                   # Hostname used for TFE
dns_zonename               = "aws.munnep.com"                          # DNS zone where the hostname record can be created
certificate_email          = "patrick.munne@hashicorp.com"             # email address used for creating valid certificates
tfe_encryption_password    = "Password#1"                              # encryption key used by TFE
tfe_license                = "02MV4UU43BK5HGYYTOJZ"                    # TFE license as a string
replica_count              = 1                                         # Number of replicas for TFE you would like to have started
tfe_license                = "<your_tfe_license_raw_text>"             # Your TFE license in raw text
tfe_release                = "v202312-1"                               # The version of TFE application you wish to be deployed   
# AWS
region                     = "eu-north-1"                              # To create the DNS record on AWS          
```
- Initialize the environment
```
terraform init
```
- Create the environment
```
terraform apply
```
- This will create 6 resources
```
Apply complete! Resources: 7 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

execute_script_to_create_user_admin = "./configure_tfe.sh tfe11.aws.munnep.com patrick.munne@hashicorp.com Password#1"
tfe_application_url = "https://tfe11.aws.munnep.com"
```
- Execute the `configure_tfe.sh tfe11.aws.munnep.com patrick.munne@hashicorp.com Password#1` script to do the following
  - Create a user called admin with the password specified
  - Create an organization called test
- login to the application on url https://tfe11.aws.munnep.com
